# biblical-timeline-vis

This project is for visualizing biblical events in a timeline using the dataset at [theographic](https://github.com/robertrouse/theographic-bible-metadata).

This project is developed under AO Labs, and specifically under the guidance and vision of two awesome individuals: Robert Rouse, the owner of theographic, and Craig Bradley, the executive director of AO Labs.

The goal is for this project to be embedded in ao.bot the seed bible of AO Labs, and in viz.bible that Robert Rouse owns. Integration with the seed bible of AO Labs takes priority, so this project will be written with the priority and context of being integrated into a casualOS environment, since this is what seed bible uses.
