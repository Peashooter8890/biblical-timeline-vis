# biblical-timeline-vis

This project is for visualizing biblical events in a timeline using the dataset at [theographic](https://github.com/robertrouse/theographic-bible-metadata).

This project is developed under AO Labs, and specifically under the guidance and vision of two awesome individuals: Robert Rouse, the owner of theographic, and Craig Bradley, the executive director of AO Labs.

The goal is for this project to be embedded in ao.bot (made in casualOS) for the seed bible of AO Labs, and also for it to be embedded in viz.bible that Robert Rouse owns.
