# biblical-timeline-vis

This project is for visualizing biblical events in a timeline using the dataset at [theographic](https://github.com/robertrouse/theographic-bible-metadata).

This project has been developed under AO Labs, and specifically under the guidance and vision of two awesome individuals: Robert Rouse, the owner of theographic, and Craig Bradley, the executive director of AO Labs.

The goal is for this project to be embedded in the seed bible owned by AO Labs, and in [viz.bible](https://viz.bible) owned by Robert Rouse. Integration with the seed bible is of the utmost priority to this project, so it will mainly be written in context of being integrated into a casualOS environment, which is where the seed bible is built on.

Therefore, this project will use preact with no typescript. It will also use cdn scripts for loading libraries/frameworks rather than installing them via npm + package.json.
